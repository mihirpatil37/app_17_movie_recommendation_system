A comprehensive movie recommendation system implementing four distinct recommendation approaches with detailed visual analytics.

## 🎥 Project Overview

This system provides movie recommendations using four different algorithmic approaches, each with specialized visualizations to demonstrate their characteristics and performance.

## 🔍 Approaches

### Popularity-Based Filtering

**Concept**: Recommends generally popular movies based on aggregate ratings.

Insight: The weighted rating formula balances between rating quality (R) and vote count (v).

$$WR = \frac{v}{v+m} \times R + \frac{m}{v+m} \times C$$

### Content-Based Filtering

**Concept**: Recommends similar movies based on content features.

## Collaborative Filtering (SVD)

**Concept**: Finds patterns in user-movie ratings using matrix factorization.


## Neural Collaborative Filtering

**Concept**: Deep learning model for complex user-item interactions.

**Model Architecture**:
## 📊 Comparative Analysis

| Approach                | Personalization | Cold Start | Complexity | Best For                |
|-------------------------|-----------------|------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Popularity-Based        | None            | Excellent  | Low        | New users               |
| Content-Based           | Medium          | Good       | Medium     | Similar item discovery  |
| Collaborative (SVD)     | High            | Poor       | Medium     | Existing users          |
| Neural CF               | Very High       | Poor       | High       | Large-scale systems     |
